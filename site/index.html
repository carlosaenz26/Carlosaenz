<h2>MES abstract</h2>
<p>This paper presents a definition: Multi Energy Renewable Autonomous Systems (MERAS). The first step is a state of the art on Multi Energy Systems (MES) and a special attention on the concepts that play a major role on these systems like reversible fuel cells technology, thermal to power devices and communication.  Then a case of study of an ecotourism hotel in chile is developed presenting results of the optimal dispatch using Open Source software. </p>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
  The increasing amount of energy  needed to produce food, offer clean potable water, process raw materials, support communications, lighting and mobile devices, etc., for the all the population in the next years, presents several challenges on efficiency[1]. 
  
  The question is how to find an optimal energy mix and its optimal operation with the lowest LCOE? this topic has been covered in many research articles [1]; Which in trend was found a new topic:  Multi Energy Renewable Autonomous Systems (MERAS)
  
  Long-lasting scenarios for energy development are based on renewable energy sources, energy efficiency, reduced emissions, and on the implementation of smart grids, which is the technology enabler for future internet connection with all the sensors providing meaningful information to predict energy demands [1].
  
  It should be noted that energy production from wind and solar plants or hydro power plants is variable and directly depends on wind intensity, solar irradiation, and available water flow. Renewable energy only will serve 27.6% of the energy demand in 2050[2]. In this sense efficiency is a key factor indicator that will be achievable only with the use of new technology devices 
  and the correct prediction of energy demands given by the analysis of the data with techniques of machine learning.
  
  Technology that takes advantage of the conversion from fuels to electricity, heat and cold and electricity-to-heat or cold play a major role achieving control and efficiency requirements and can be realized using electric heater, heat pumps, and chillers. Advanced organic Rankine cycles (ORC) and TEG also make heat/cold-to-electricity possible [1][ Advanced organic Rankine cycles].
  
  A MERAS consist of five subsystems that can form a supply-demand interactive and energy-efficient autonomous system: Energy generation subsystem, energy storage subsystem, energy recovery subsystem, energy end-use subsystem and a communication subsystem together a perfect synergy with the propose of efficiency and prediction of the energy demand. For each subsystem, there are current energy devices commercially available or under research that will be introduce.
